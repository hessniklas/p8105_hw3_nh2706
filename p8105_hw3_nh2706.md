# Problem 1

Omitted, as solutions are provided by Professor.

# Problem 2

#### First, I am loading and cleaning the data ahead of the next problems

``` r
accel_df = read_csv("Data/accel_data.csv") %>%
  
  # cleaning the names, creating a new 'weekend' variable, and adjusting variable format.
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(weekend = ifelse((day == "Saturday" | day == "Sunday"),"Weekend","Weekday"),
         day = as.factor(day),
         weekend = as.factor(weekend))  %>%
  
  # relocating variables in desired order
  relocate(week,day_id, day,weekend)
```

-   The dataset contains the following key variables week, day_id, day,
    weekend
-   There are 35 observations and 1444 variables
-   The dataset covers accelerometer data from an individual patient
    over a 5 week period

#### Second, I am calculating the activity totals and then dropping the individuals activity variables

``` r
aggregate_accel_df = accel_df %>%
  
  # Creating a new total_activity variable
  mutate(total_activity = rowSums(accel_df[,c(5:1444)])) %>%
  
  #Grouping the dataset by day_id, relocating the dataset, and dropping all detailed activity variables
  group_by(day_id) %>%
  relocate(week,day_id, day,weekend,total_activity) %>%
  select(1:5)

knitr::kable(aggregate_accel_df)
```

|    5 |     32 | Sunday    | Weekend |      138421.00 |
|    5 |     33 | Thursday  | Weekday |      549658.00 |
|    5 |     34 | Tuesday   | Weekday |      367824.00 |
|    5 |     35 | Wednesday | Weekday |      445366.00 |

To better understand potential trends, I am graphing the resulting data
in the next section.

#### Third, I am showing the day activity to identify any interesting trends throughout the study period.

``` r
ggplot(aggregate_accel_df,aes(x = day_id, y = total_activity, color = weekend)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Total Activity per day (for study period by week(end/day))",
    x = "Day ID",
    y = "Total Activity",
    caption = "Visual Depiction of accel_data.csv for daily trends"
    ) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,35,by = 5)) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_nh2706_files/figure-gfm/plot_1_accel-1.png" width="95%" />
There are no real clear trends visible - the data shows that activity
varies significantly and throughout all days. During the last 2 weeks of
the study, weekend activity drops significantly, but this is not the
case during the first 3 weeks. Further investigation will be required to
draw clear conclusions.

#### Fourth, I am converting the data to long-format, to be able to plot minutes by days

``` r
accel_longer_df = accel_df %>%
  
  # adjusting data into a long format by activity and mutating variable format for next step
  pivot_longer(
    cols = activity_1:activity_1440,
    names_to = "minute",
    values_to = "activity",
    names_prefix = "activity_"
    ) %>% 
  mutate(minute = as.numeric(minute))
```

#### Firth (and last), I am plotting the long format of minutes and activity by day to show any daily trends throughout the week.

``` r
accel_longer_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = minute, y = activity, color = day)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(alpha = .3) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,1440,by = 60),
                     label = seq(0,24,by = 1),
                     limits = c(0,1440)) +
  labs(
    title = "24-hour Activity Time Courses for each Day",
    x = "Minutes (Hours shown)",
    y = "Activity",
    caption = "Visual Depiction of accel_data.csv for trends"
    )
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_nh2706_files/figure-gfm/plot_2_accel-1.png" width="95%" />
The graph shows that activity is centered around specific times during
the day. Most notably, during the evening between 8pm and 10pm is the
most active time. Other active times are around 7am, 11am-12pm, and
around 5pm. However, during the rest of the day, there is almost no
activity. These patterns appear to show the patients daily schedules
(from wake-up, over lunch, to evening activity) and one can conclude
that an increase in activity during the remaining (non-sleeping) times
could improve health outcomes.

# Problem 3

#### First, I load the data from the p8105.datasets

``` r
data("ny_noaa")
```

#### Second, I describe the Data

The data shows 7 variables (id, date, prcp, snow, snwd, tmax, tmin) from
New York state weather stations from January 1, 1981 through December
31, 2010. It has 2595176 obersvations. Key variables include id, which
denotes the weather station ID, and date, which indicates the date of
each subsequent observation. Since each weather station might not
collect all variables, missing data is a major issue in the context of
this data.

#### Third, I am cleaning the data ahead of the next problems

``` r
clean_noaa_df = ny_noaa %>%
  
  #Cleaning data and mutating variables to be in standard and usable format
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = '-') %>%
  mutate(month = as.numeric(month),
         year = as.numeric(year),
         month = factor(month.abb[month], levels = month.abb),
         tmax = as.numeric(tmax)/10,
         tmin = as.numeric(tmin)/10,
         prcp = as.numeric(prcp)/10)
```

#### Fourth, I calculate the Mode for Snow and describe the rationale in more detail

``` r
# Calcualting function for in-line r use for next sentence
find_mode <- function(a) {
  value <- unique(a)
  tab <- tabulate(match(a, value))
  value[tab == max(tab)]
}
```

The most commonly observed values for snowfall are 0, which makes sense
because most of the year there is no snow-fall.

#### Fifth, I graph a two-panel plot showing the average max temperature in January and in July in each station across years

``` r
mean_max_temp = clean_noaa_df %>%
  
  # Filtering and Grouping dataset for further use
  filter(month == "Jan" | month == "Jul") %>%  
  group_by(id, year, month) %>% 
  
  # Creating the mean_max_temperature variable to be graphed
  summarize(mean_temperature = mean(tmax, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
 
  #Graphing the mean_max_temperature by years, paneled by month, and grouped by ID
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_temperature, group = id)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(. ~ month) +
  labs(
    title = "Max temperature in January and in July in each station across years",
    x = "Years among weather stations",
    y = "Mean_Max_temperature",
    caption = "Data from ny_noaa") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

mean_max_temp
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_nh2706_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="95%" />

The graph clearly shows a number of structures:

-   Mean max temps are much lower in January than July, which was
    clearly expected
-   The trend of January max temperatures appear to have been increasing
    since the first observation. This fits with the global warming
    phenomenon.
-   Temperatures have been fluctuating significantly throughout the
    years - somewhat regularly, max temps have been moving +- 10(C)
    every few years. This is an interesting phenomenon and should be
    studied closer.
-   There are a few outlier temperature points throughout the years,
    which likely pertain to a temperature station that experienced an
    abnormal weather condition.

#### Sixth, I graph a two-panel plot showing tmax vs tmin for the full dataset

``` r
# Plotting left panel of the graph, which will depict min- and max-temperatures for the entire dataset
maxmin_plot = clean_noaa_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = tmax, y = tmin)) +
  geom_hex() +
  labs(title = "Max vs Min Temp over years",
       x = "Max Temp (C)",
       y = "Min Temp (C)",
       caption = "Data from NY NOAA.") +
  theme(legend.position = "left")

# Plotting right panel of the graph, which will depict distribution of snowfall values greater than 0 and less than 100 separately by year
snowfall_plot = clean_noaa_df %>%
  filter(snow > 0, snow < 100) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = snow, y = as.factor(year))) +
  geom_density_ridges(scale = 0.9) +
  xlim(0, 100) +
  labs(title = "Snowfall Distribution by Year (0-100 mm)",
       x = "Snowfall",
       y = "Year",
       caption = "Data from NY NOAA.")

# Graphing both together
maxmin_plot + snowfall_plot
```
